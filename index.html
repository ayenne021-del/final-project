  <h1>The Quest for Quality [Education]</h1>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="p-img-row">
  <p class="first-p">At every early stage in a person’s life they may encounter the question, “What do you want to be when 
    you grow up?”. For some, it may not need much thinking. But for most, it’s a hard question to answer. 
    According to the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), two out of every five 
    15-year-old students have no coherent plans regarding their future. A study of Australian secondary 
    school students found that over one-third (33.8%) agreed or strongly agreed that they didn't know what 
    careers suited them best, and even more (40.5%) felt they had no career direction. Of course, given 
    their ages, most teenagers do not have solid career plans yet. Although, it’s better to have a 
    plan—regardless of whether it’s solid or not—than to have none.</p>

  <div class="p-img-row-2">
  <p id="p2">Even adults suffer with the consequences of improper career planning, or the lack thereof. 80% of 
    college students tend to switch to different majors (DuSold, 2024). These high numbers are the 
    results of detailed guidance regarding careers not being offered to students world-wide. Which 
    means that the journey towards a proper and sustainable career must start during a person’s youth. 
    After all, it’s never too early to start thinking. In fact, the earlier people consider their options 
    based on their interests and the needs of the current job market, the more time they would have to 
    change what they would like to accomplish in their future. Instead of dreading indecisiveness, people 
    could actually come to school sure and ready to learn without questioning if they made the right 
    decision by stepping into a specific class. Many adults regret not thinking about their careers 
    in-depth. Based on all of this information, teens are now in need of the headstart that many—if 
    not all—adults once wanted.</p>

  <h2 id="raheading">Recent Approaches</h2>
<div class="pthreefour">
<p>Across the globe, organizations and governments are attempting to address the rising issue of career 
  uncertainty. Most nations have implemented extensive career guidance systems, which many initiate in 
  schools, to enable students to discover their interests and abilities early enough. Initiatives such as 
  career fairs, mentorship, and career guidance workshops are prevalent. International organizations such 
  as the World Economic Forum are not immune to this dialogue, pointing to the necessity for individuals 
  to repeatedly upskill and reskill to remain relevant in an ever-evolving job market fueled by technology. 
  Regardless of these concerted efforts and expenditures, the outcomes are regularly ambiguous. One 
  finding of particular significance from the OECD is that in spite of greater exposure to advice, 
  youth career uncertainty has increased over the past few years. That indicates that although there are 
  available resources, they're not entirely addressing the basic issue individuals encounter in a world 
  where a "job for life" isn't possible.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, there's a concerted effort to prepare the workforce, especially the youth. 
  Government agencies like the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and the Department of Education 
  (DepEd) run programs like JobStart Philippines, which helps young people get training and employment 
  opportunities. The country’s K-12 curriculum also includes career guidance to help students choose the 
  right track. Beyond the government, the private sector plays a big role, with companies holding career 
  talks and job fairs at universities. While these initiatives are well-intentioned and do help some people,
   they often fall short. Research in the Philippines points to a persistent mismatch between what students 
   are taught and what the job market actually needs. This gap means that even with guidance, many 
   graduates end up in jobs unrelated to their degrees or feel a deep sense of uncertainty about their 
   future. Ultimately, while career planning programs are a step in the right direction, they are simply 
   not enough to fix the larger, systemic issues that continue to leave many Filipinos uncertain about 
   their careers.</p>

  <div class="text-columns">
    <div class="text-column">
      <p>We can propose putting career planning into school classes, not just as a one-time event. For example, a science class could explore jobs in environmental science, making learning more relevant and connecting it to real-world careers.
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-column">
<p>But even without this, a simple, user-friendly website can be a great help. It would be like a digital mentor, with easy-to-use tools like interest quizzes, job information, and success stories. This platform could give people the guidance they need on their own, especially if other resources are not available.
