    <p>There are two problems students run into when thinking about their careers. The first problem is the lack of guidance. The second problem is uncertainty. Many of our fellow students suffered from the latter. Which is why we made this site to talk about it, and propose possible solutions. Our group started out when we were teens. We were highly ambitious, and wanted to achieve many things. The main problem we encountered was the lack of proper guidance. When we were teens, the adults around us were also in the process of figuring things out for themselves. In the end, we became big dreamers to cope with the lack of guidance in hopes to have a larger scope for future jobs.
</p>
<p>In the hopes of preventing these struggles from reaching the future generations, we thought of how much better it would be if students actually had a subject dedicated to career planning. The adults around them would teach them about the kinds of careers out there, with activities that could help them explore their inner selves and outer communities. As a group, we believe that in doing so could help us achieve the fourth Sustainable Development Goal of Quality Education. Through the process of students learning something they could use all throughout their lives, we could live in a much more informed world.

<p>I am Quoleen, the initiator of The Quest for Quality project. If you've been following along, you may
    be aware of my other smaller works such as Leadership | The Quest for Quality. I've been planning the
    Career Planning, Education edition of this series, because it has been a major part of my life. I am 
    a person who has struggled thinking about their career and what exact steps I'd need to take in order to
    achieve my career. This page was written to inspire others, give awareness to the importance of career
    planning, and speak on the status of career guidance. I firmly believe that in establishing proper career
    guidance, that quality education may be achieved.
